## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## üé∞ DomusJackpot Smart Contract

The DomusJackpot contract is a sophisticated jackpot system with liquidity provider (LP) functionality that allows users to participate in regular jackpot rounds.

### Operational Flow

#### 1. Contract Initialization

- The contract is initialized with key parameters:
  - Owner address
  - Entropy provider address (for randomness)
  - Token address (ERC20 token used for tickets)
  - Ticket price

#### 2. Round Preparation

- LPs deposit tokens with a specified risk percentage
  - LPs provide liquidity to the jackpot pool
  - Risk percentage determines their exposure to potential losses
- Users purchase tickets using the specified ERC20 token
  - Users can purchase tickets with or without referrals
  - Referrals receive a percentage of the ticket price as a fee

#### 3. Jackpot Execution

- The jackpot can be executed once per round (default: 24 hours)
- Execution requirements:
  - Current time must be ‚â• lastJackpotEndTime + roundDurationInSeconds
  - The jackpotLock must be false (no jackpot currently running)
  - Sufficient ETH must be provided to cover the entropy fee
- Execution process:
  1. The jackpotLock is set to true to prevent concurrent executions
  2. A random number is requested from the entropy provider
  3. When the random number is received, a winner is selected
  4. Prizes are distributed to the winner
  5. Fees are allocated to the protocol and referrers
  6. The jackpot is reset for the next round

#### 4. Prize Distribution

- The winner receives a portion of the jackpot pool
- LP providers receive returns based on their risk percentage
- Protocol fees are collected
- Referral fees are distributed to referrers

## üé∞ DomusJackpot Smart Contract

The DomusJackpot contract is an innovative jackpot system with Liquidity Provider (LP) functionality that creates an engaging and sustainable prize mechanism for users.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Randomness**: Uses Entropy protocol for verifiable and secure random number generation
- **Liquidity Provider System**: Allows LPs to participate with configurable risk percentages
- **Ticket Purchase Mechanism**: Users can buy tickets to participate in jackpot rounds
- **Referral System**: Incentivizes user acquisition through referral rewards
- **Automated Jackpot Execution**: Scheduled jackpot rounds with configurable duration
- **Fee Distribution**: Transparent fee structure with allocation to LPs, referrers, and protocol
- **Upgradeable Design**: Implements UUPS proxy pattern for future upgrades
- **Configurable Parameters**: Admin controls for ticket price, round duration, fee percentages, etc.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Includes locks, limits, and emergency functions

### Contract Structure

The DomusJackpot contract manages two main participant types:

1. **Users**: Purchase tickets to participate in jackpot rounds
   ```solidity
   struct User {
       uint256 ticketsPurchasedTotalBps; // Tickets purchased for current round (basis points)
       uint256 winningsClaimable;        // Amount of tokens user can withdraw
       bool active;                      // Whether user is participating in current round
   }
   ```

2. **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Deposit tokens and set risk percentages
   ```solidity
   struct LP {
       uint256 principal;      // Amount deposited by LP
       uint256 stake;          // Amount staked in current jackpot round
       uint256 riskPercentage; // From 0 to 100
       bool active;            // Whether LP has principal in contract
   }
   ```

### Jackpot Operation Flow

#### 1. Initialization and Setup

- Contract is deployed with initial parameters (ticket price, round duration, fee percentages)
- Token address is set for the jackpot system (ERC20 token used for tickets and rewards)
- Owner configures limits for LPs and users

#### 2. LP Participation

- LPs deposit tokens using `lpDeposit(riskPercentage, value)`
- LPs set their risk percentage (1-100%) determining exposure to jackpot outcomes
- LP deposits are tracked in the `lpsInfo` mapping and `activeLpAddresses` array
- LPs can adjust risk percentage with `lpAdjustRiskPercentage(riskPercentage)`
- LPs can withdraw their principal with `withdrawAllLP()` when not staked

#### 3. User Ticket Purchases

- Users purchase tickets with `purchaseTickets(referrer, value, recipient)`
- Ticket purchases are tracked in `usersInfo` mapping and `activeUserAddresses` array
- Fees are calculated and distributed:
  - Referral fees go to referrers
  - LP fees accumulate for distribution to LPs
  - Remaining amount goes to user pool

#### 4. Jackpot Execution

1. **Initiation**: Anyone can trigger jackpot after round duration with `runJackpot(userRandomNumber)`
2. **Random Number Generation**: Contract requests randomness from Entropy protocol
3. **Entropy Callback**: When randomness is received, `entropyCallback()` processes the jackpot:
   - `stakeLps()`: Moves LP funds from principal to stake based on risk percentage
   - `distributeLpFeesToLps()`: Distributes accumulated fees to LPs
   - `determineWinnerAndAdjustStakes()`: Selects winner and allocates prizes

#### 5. Winner Determination Logic

The contract has three possible outcomes:

1. **User Pool ‚â• LP Pool**: 
   - Winner gets entire user pool
   - LPs get their stake back

2. **User Pool < LP Pool and User Wins**:
   - Winner gets entire LP pool
   - LPs get user pool distributed proportionally to their stakes

3. **User Pool < LP Pool and LP Wins**:
   - LPs get both user pool and LP pool
   - No user winner

#### 6. Post-Jackpot Actions

- Winner can claim rewards with `withdrawWinnings()`
- Referrers can claim fees with `withdrawReferralFees()`
- New round begins automatically with:
  - User tickets reset
  - New LP stakes calculated based on risk percentages
  - Pool totals reset

### Administrative Controls

- **Ticket Price**: Configurable with `setTicketPrice()`
- **Round Duration**: Adjustable with `setRoundDurationInSeconds()`
- **Fee Structure**: Configurable with `setFeeBps()` and `setReferralFeeBps()`
- **LP Pool Cap**: Set with `setLpPoolCap()`
- **Protocol Fee**: Managed with `setProtocolFeeAddress()` and `setProtocolFeeThreshold()`
- **Emergency Controls**: Include `forceReleaseJackpotLock()` for recovery

### Automation

The jackpot system can be automated using:
- GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled execution
- Configurable parameters for different networks
- Script-based interaction for jackpot execution and information retrieval

### Security Features

- Entropy protocol for verifiable randomness
- Jackpot and entropy callback locks to prevent duplicate execution
- Withdrawal pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Principal/stake separation for LP risk management
- Fallback winner mechanism

### Events

The contract emits events for all major actions:
- `UserTicketPurchase`: When tickets are purchased
- `JackpotRunRequested`: When jackpot execution is initiated
- `JackpotRun`: When jackpot completes with winner information
- `EntropyResult`: When random number is received
- `LpDeposit`, `LpRebalance`, `LpRiskPercentageAdjustment`: For LP actions
- Various withdrawal events for tracking fund movements

#### 5. Automation

- The jackpot execution is automated through a GitHub Actions workflow
- The workflow can be triggered:
  - Automatically on a daily schedule
  - Manually through the GitHub UI with configurable parameters
- The automation ensures timely execution of jackpot rounds without manual intervention

### Key Functions

#### For Users

- `purchaseTickets`: Buy tickets for the current jackpot round
- `getTicketPrice`: Get the current ticket price
- `getUserInfo`: Get information about a user's tickets and winnings

#### For Liquidity Providers

- `lpDeposit`: Deposit tokens as a liquidity provider with a specified risk percentage
- `lpWithdraw`: Withdraw LP tokens and accrued fees
- `getLPInfo`: Get information about an LP's deposits and earnings

#### For Jackpot Operations

- `runJackpot`: Execute the jackpot process and select a winner
- `getJackpotInfo`: Get comprehensive information about the current jackpot state
- `getJackpotStatus`: Check if the jackpot is currently running and when the next round is available

### Automation Tools

The project includes scripts and GitHub Actions workflows for automated jackpot operations:

- `interact_jackpot.ts`: Script for interacting with the DomusJackpot contract
  - Commands for purchasing tickets, depositing LP, and running the jackpot
  - Functions for retrieving jackpot information and status
- `cron-job.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for automated jackpot execution
  - Scheduled daily execution
  - Manual triggering with configurable parameters
  - Network selection for different environments

### Security Considerations

- The contract uses a trusted entropy source for randomness
- Timelock mechanisms prevent premature jackpot executions
- The jackpotLock prevents concurrent executions
- Fee calculations ensure fair distribution of prizes and incentives
